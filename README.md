Welcome to Row Row Row your Boat, oh BUOY, aren't you in for a treat, I hope you get reeled in by our excitement! It is aboat time we get started, and first we will get anchored into the intro of each code file. It is anchor-aged to read this before running the code to get an idea of how it runs, i hope you do knot try to run it because you may not have a crew aboat it...but you know how it is sometimes with pier pressure.

I mast as-shore you, it won't go off course and will be "Pacific". I wreck-en it would be interesting oar even, it might coarse a sea-zure
Anyhow, i shoal carry on and you know what the saying is.. lets "Seas the day!"
